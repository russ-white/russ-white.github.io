/**
 * Helper class to deduplicate concurrent HTTP requests on the same URLs.
 *
 * The main use case is to be able to handle complex cancellation scenarios when a given request
 * can be "owned" by multiple `AbortSignal`s.
 *
 * ### Deduplication
 *
 * The first time a `fetch` request is called for a given URL, the request is actually started.
 * But subsequent calls to `fetch()` will always return the promise of the first call, as long
 * as the first call is still active. In other word, as soon as the request completes, it is removed
 * from the internal cache.
 *
 * ### Cancellation support
 *
 * All subsequent calls to `fetch()` will attach their own `AbortSignal` to the existing request.
 * When _all_ signals for a given request are aborted, then the request is aborted.
