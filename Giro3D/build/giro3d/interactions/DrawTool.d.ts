/**
 * A tool that allows interactive creation and edition of {@link Shape}s.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * To create shapes, you can either use one of the preset methods ({@link createSegment},
 * {@link createPolygon}...), or start creating a free shape with {@link createShape}.
 *
 * This method allows fine control over the constraints to apply to the shape (how many vertices,
 * styling options, what component to display...).
 *
 * ## Edition
 *
 * The {@link enterEditMode} method allows the user to edit any shape that the mouse interacts with.
 * Depending on the constraints put on the shape during the creation (assuming of course that the
 * shape was created with this tool), some operations might not be permitted.
 *
 * To exit edition mode, call {@link exitEditMode}.
 *
 * ### Examples of constraints
 *
 * - If a shape was created with the {@link createSegment} method, it is not possible to insert
 * or remove points, because the constraint forces the shape to have exactly 2 points.
 *
 * - If a shape was created with the {@link createPolygon} method, then any time the user moves the first or
 * last vertex, the other one is automatically moved at the same position, to ensure the shape
 * remains closed.
