/**
 * Abstract base class for all entities in Giro3D.
 * The Entity is the core component of Giro3D and represent an updatable
 * object that is added to an {@link core.Instance | Instance}.
 *
 * The class inherits three.js' [`EventDispatcher`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=even#api/en/core/EventDispatcher).
 *
 * ### The `userData` property
 *
 * The `userData` property can be used to attach custom data to the entity, in a type safe manner.
 * It is recommended to use this property instead of attaching arbitrary properties to the object:
 *
 * ```ts
 * type MyCustomUserData = {
 *   creationDate: Date;
 *   owner: string;
 * };
 * const entity: Entity<MyCustomUserData> = ...;
 *
 * entity.userData.creationDate = Date.now();
 * entity.userData.owner = 'John Doe';
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * The lifetime of an entity follows this pattern: when the entity is added to an instance, its
 * {@link preprocess} method is called. When the promise
 * returned by this method resolves, the entity can be used in the main loop, where the update
 * methods (see below) will be used to update the entity over time. Finally, when the entity is
 * removed from the instance, its {@link dispose} method
 * is called to cleanup memory.
 *
 * ### The update methods
 *
 * This class exposes three methods to update the object:
 * - {@link Entity.preUpdate}
 * to determine which _parts_ of the object should actually be updated.
 * - {@link Entity.update} called for each part returned
 * by `preUpdate()`
 * - {@link Entity.postUpdate} to finalize
 * the update step.
 *
 * ### A note on "parts"
 *
 * The notion of "part to be updated" is entity-specific. For example, if the entity is a tiled map,
 * the parts may be map tiles. If the entity is a point cloud, it may be point clusters, and so on.
 * On the other hand, if the entity is not made of distinct objects, the "part to update" may be the
 * entity itself, or a dummy object.
 *
 * ```js
 * const instance = new Instance(...);
 * const entity = new Entity('exampleEntity');
 * instance.add(entity);
 * ```
 * @typeParam TEventMap - The event map of the entity.
 * @typeParam TUserData - The type of the `userData` property.
